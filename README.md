# UFOs
## Overview of Project
### Background

The client asked for a dynamic webpage that accepts user inputs and adjusts accordingly. The client's focus is to provide UFO information in the webpage. This project was completed by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page.

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to add filters including date, city, state, country and shape to the dynamic webpage.

### Results

### Summary

Although the dynamic webpage includes UFO sightings, a drawback is that it only includes information for the year 2010. A recommendation for further development of this webpage would be to add a scrape button to allow users to scrape up to date information. Another recommendation is to include images of the UFO sightings if the images are available.
